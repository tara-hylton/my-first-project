## Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw

I have 2 cats. A black male manx named Hufflepuff and a female calico named Ravenclaw. It was just coincidence that they fit their Harry Potter house mascots.
**Hufflepuff** is a badger. My Huffle, as he prefers to be called, steals food, bullies his sister and annoys me whenever I have my laptop out. 
**Ravenclaw** is an eagle. My Raven, as she ignores whatever name is called, goes her own way and smacks her brother around with her talons as needed. 
I didn?t intend for Harry Potter cats to take over my house, it just happened that way.
*My neighbor has 2 orange barn cats. I think they may be Weasleys.*
